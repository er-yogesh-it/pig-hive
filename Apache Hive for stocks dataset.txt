#Managed vs External Table

#Managed Table: It has full control over its dataset. When we drop table, its datasets, files are deleted from HDFS. We use this when table is being used by Hive application only.
#External Table: It has no control over its dataset. When we drop table, its datasets, files are not deleted from HDFS. We use this when table is being used by many applications like pig, MapReduce.

# Create Managed Table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stocks (symbol string, ymd string, price_open float, price_high float, price_low float, price_close float, volume int) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';

# Describe table type
DESCRIBE FORMATTED stocks_db.stocks;

# Execute HDFS commands from hive terminal
!hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/stocks_db.db/stocks;

SELECT * from stocks;
DROP table stocks;
SELECT * from stocks;

# Create External Table
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stocks (symbol string, ymd string, price_open float, price_high float, price_low float, price_close float, volume int) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
